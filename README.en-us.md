# Pymaidol

[简体中文 (Simplified Chinese) ](README.md) | English

Pymaidol is a markup syntax for embedding Python code into text, allowing the content to be dynamically changed at runtime.

Compared to [ProMaid](https://github.com/Eterance/ProMaid), Pymaidol not only embeds data into corresponding positions in templates, but also allows complex processing logic to be presented in templates. It can even use functions defined in templates to process data.

⚠ **Warning: Pymaidol is currently in the development stage, and the syntax and some handling logic for whitespace and line breaks are not yet finalized and may be subject to change in the future. It is strongly recommended not to use it in a production environment.**

## Requirements and Installation

python >= 3.10

``` bash
pip install Pymaidol -i https://pypi.python.org/simple
```
